									<p>44 south village, the first military village in Taipei. After six years of discussion between the government and the residents, it was reconstructed as a citizen recreation center and cultural park, and was opened in October 25. Ex-mayor Ma, Ying-Jiu hosted the ceremony and celebrated the birth of the park with the citizens.</p>
									<p>After the war, the families started building the 44 south village. The house was built in a very simple way and was crowded in a bone shaped array. 1960, Taiwan industry rise and 44 south village were also in the change list. 1973, zone A of the village were reconstructed and become the ZhuangJing Road today. 1999, all the residents moved and so the XinYi development plan can take place. The history and culture were merged with the new era.</p>
									<p>Ex-mayor Ma, YingJiu states that no matter how time shifts, we must not forget the culture for the land we were born on. 44 south village's memory and culture were records of those. 50 years of development, although the children may have moved away, the land and history are still one of the most important part in Taiwan history. Military village is a experience throughout the entire island and was buried deep in all of our lives.</p>
									<p>Zone C of the 44 south village were repurposed for XinYi elementary school. Zone B became the XinYi resident recreation center and culture park. Wu, Xiu-Guang, the leader of the citizen department, The XinYi resident recreation center left the original look of the bone-shaped structure. The internal were also designed to merge both exhibition and activities. Other than the historical pictures, we're expecting more culture and arts performance take place in this heart of Taiwan.</p>
									<p>The design of the culture park is focused on community interaction and earth friendly recreation. By simulating the low rooftop of the village by planting green plants on top. You can lie on it and enjoy the star. Viewing from Taipei 101 reveals the place as green plants. The external space provides residents and communities a place to interact.</p>
