									<p>This recreation center used to be the historical architecture "44 South Village". Due to it's location being in the most busy part of Taipei City, it has formed a unique unban landscape as modern and historical structure stand side by side. In addition, the open landscape and outdoor plaza has made this recreation center one of the most used in Taiwan. The retro-styled building also draw a lot of new brides to take their bridal photo here. Not only its historical architecture but also the plazas together with iconic design using the village's rooftop as grass field makes this place an award-winning recreation center, so far, it managed to get numerous design award both in 2004 and 2005.</p>
									<p>As the city development continues, the cultural part of it can always play a part in preserve (emotion) and memory. Just like the historical building reflect the growth of a city, past memories can trigger a common emotional relationship, connecting people with the village they grew up from. Military village is the creation when Republic Of China government moved from Mainland to Taiwan. Countless memories of the past in the villages are the most important treasure to those who came along with the government. The sense of community and unique culture in military village is vanishing along with city improvement proposals. It has become one of the most valuable part of Taiwan agricultural history. Government tries to preserve the culture by encouraging villages reconstruction, they also funded the "Military Village Preserve and Development Team" and invites numerous leader and experts to create constructive plans for these fading treasures. </p>
