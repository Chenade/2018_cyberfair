									<p>44 South Village was built in 1949, it is the first military village in Taiwan. "LianQing 44 Arsenal" was named "Central Mechnic and Repair Department". Funded in July 1936, it moved from places time to time. In 1937, it moved from HuNan ChangSha. 1938, when the Japanese come closer, it moved again to GuiZhou, where they manufactured different weapons such as guns and hand grenades. 1943, it renamed to "Military Manufacture Department 44 Arsenal" and moved to QingDao in 1946. 1948, the civil war forced the employee and the families onboard the TaiKang warship where they traveled to Keelung, Taiwan. It later renamed again to LianQing 44 arsenal and settled in at where XinYi development zone now. Nearby district used to be the first coal mine in Taiwan and during the Japanese era a train track was built. Arsenal repurposed it to move different types of cargo. In 1970, the track was demolished. 44 arsenal produced ballistics and flairs after moving to Taiwan. Most of the factory building reuses the warehouse built by the Japanese. Producing firearms can be hazardous, therefore nearby architectural development is prohibited. The ancient buildings and the rules preserved the military feel left behind by the Japanese era.</p>
									<p>The employee of the arsenal mostly live in the neighborhood and are technicians with skill. At first, the employee live in the warehouse and are separated using only cloths. They started building wooden house outside illegally to solve the ever-growing population problem. In 1948, the government built 44 South Village (Dist. C) and in 1949 and 1950, the South Village(Dist. B) and Dist. A were built. East village were built primarily for officer who has a rank. East and South are usually for the technicians. 1951, all the construction finished.</p>
