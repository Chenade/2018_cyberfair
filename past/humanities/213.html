									<p>For the people who used to live in the military village, the food stands for the home they came from. It wasn't luxurious or expensive, but it shows the purity of the traditional culture. Now the residents moved into the city and a lot of the village were reconstructed into new buildings, the preservation of the original taste of the culture has become lesser and lesser. Making the food extremely unique.</p>

The government retreat to Taiwan in 1949, taking the major 8 Chinese food together with them, which later become the unique food culture in military village. They usually use whatever they have in their home and create the maximum difference between each dish. Every family has its own unique style.</p>
